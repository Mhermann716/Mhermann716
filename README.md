Currently immersed in the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate program, I am sharpening my expertise in key technical competencies such as network security, cryptography, penetration testing, and incident response. With a fervent passion for cybersecurity, I am committed to safeguarding digital assets and mitigating cyber threats in an ever-evolving digital landscape.

My professional journey has been defined by diverse experiences, including roles as a Sales Manager at AT&T and a Director of Communications at Keller Williams Realty. Through these roles, I have honed invaluable skills in strategic thinking, problem-solving, and effective communication, along with being a strong self learner. Notable achievements include navigating complex negotiations to secure major contracts and spearheading successful communication initiatives that fostered collaboration across departments.

As I transition into the cybersecurity field, I am eager to merge my technical knowledge with my transferable skills to make a meaningful impact. With a strong foundation in strategic thinking, problem-solving, and communication, I am poised to thrive in roles that demand agility, innovation, and a proactive approach to cybersecurity challenges.
