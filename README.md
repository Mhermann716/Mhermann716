Currently immersed in the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate program, I am diligently honing my expertise in critical technical domains including network security, cryptography, penetration testing, and incident response. Driven by an unyielding passion for cybersecurity, my mission is to safeguard digital assets and combat evolving cyber threats within today's dynamic digital landscape.

My professional trajectory is marked by a diverse array of experiences, notably including positions as a Sales Manager at AT&T and as Director of Communications at Keller Williams Realty. Through these roles, I have cultivated invaluable skills in strategic thinking, problem-solving, and effective communication, underscored by a relentless commitment to self-improvement. Notable achievements encompass navigating intricate negotiations to secure pivotal contracts and spearheading communication initiatives that fostered seamless collaboration across departments.

As I embark on my transition into the cybersecurity arena, I am enthusiastic about fusing my technical proficiency with my repertoire of transferable skills to effectuate meaningful change. Anchored in a bedrock of strategic acumen, problem-solving prowess, and polished communication, I stand ready to excel in roles that demand agility, innovation, and a proactive stance against cybersecurity threats.


## Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
